## HaskellClass

Small collection of simple Haskell exercise programs used for learning and demonstration.

### Overview

This repository contains a few short Haskell programs (exercise solutions). Each file is a self-contained program that can be compiled with GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and run as a standalone executable.

### Files

- `quadraticequation.hs` — solve quadratic equations (roots for ax^2 + bx + c = 0).
- `compoundinterest.hs` — compute compound interest examples (principal, rate, periods).
- `sumandsquares.hs` — small program demonstrating sums and squares of integers.

Compiled artefacts (if present): `*.o` and `*.hi` files generated by GHC.

### Prerequisites

- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) 8.x/9.x or newer
- A POSIX shell (bash is used in examples below)

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install GHC with:

```bash
# install GHC via apt (may provide an older version)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ghc

# or use ghcup for latest recommended toolchain
# see: https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/
```

### Build (compile)

To compile a single file:

```bash
cd /home/dushmin/Documents/Projects/haskell/HaskellClass
ghc -O2 -Wall -o quadeq quadraticequation.hs
ghc -O2 -Wall -o compoundinterest compoundinterest.hs
ghc -O2 -Wall -o sumandsquares sumandsquares.hs
```

### Run

After compiling, run the produced executable(s):

```bash
./quadeq            # runs quadraticequation program
./compoundinterest  # runs compoundinterest program
./sumandsquares     # runs sumandsquares program
```
